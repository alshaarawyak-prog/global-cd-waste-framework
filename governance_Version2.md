# Framework governance and stewardship

## Ownership and stewardship

The Global Construction and Demolition Waste Framework is privately developed and maintained as an independent technical reference framework. Ownership of the framework, including its structure, terminology, and methodological artefacts, resides with its author as framework steward.

Stewardship is exercised to ensure technical consistency, controlled evolution, and long-term methodological integrity. The framework is not governed by commercial interest, advocacy positions, or sector-specific agendas.

## Scope of authority

The framework does not assert regulatory, legal, or enforcement authority. Its scope is limited to the specification of technical definitions, data structures, metrics, and methodological constructs that may be referenced or adopted by external parties at their discretion.

Adoption, integration, or citation of the framework does not imply endorsement, compliance, or certification unless explicitly stated by the adopting entity.

## Change control and versioning

All modifications to the framework are subject to controlled change management. Updates are issued as discrete versions and are documented to preserve traceability and reproducibility.

Change control principles include:
- versioned release of framework documents,
- documentation of substantive methodological changes,
- preservation of superseded versions for reference,
- backward compatibility where technically feasible.

The framework steward retains responsibility for approving revisions and publishing updated versions.

## Separation between specification and application

The framework specifies reference structures and methodologies only. Application, interpretation, and operational use are the responsibility of adopting authorities or organisations.

The framework does not provide operational services, project execution, regulatory assessment, or commercial delivery. Its role is confined to specification and technical alignment.

## External participation

External technical input may be solicited on a selective basis to support validation, clarification, or refinement of specific framework components. Such input does not confer governance rights or authorship unless formally documented.

No representation of collective governance, institutional partnership, or multi-stakeholder authority is implied at the current stage of development.
