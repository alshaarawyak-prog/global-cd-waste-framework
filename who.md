# Framework authorship

The framework is authored and maintained by a civil engineer with a technical background spanning construction execution, systems analysis, and decision-support methodology. The work reflects experience across multiple jurisdictions and project contexts, with a focus on formalising technical practices that are widely applied but inconsistently defined.

The author’s role is limited to framework design, specification, and methodological governance. The framework is developed as a neutral technical reference and is not positioned as a consultancy product, advocacy initiative, or regulatory instrument.

Authorship is structured to ensure continuity of methodology, controlled evolution of technical artefacts, and separation between framework specification and external application or adoption.
