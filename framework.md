# Global Construction and Demolition Waste Framework — Modular specification

This document specifies the modular structure of the Global Construction and Demolition (C&D) Waste Framework. Each module is defined in terms of purpose, primary functions, and explicit boundaries indicating the aspects that fall outside its scope.

The framework is normative and technical in character. It defines reference terminology, data structures, metrics, and methodological interfaces intended to support interoperable implementation by institutional stakeholders. It does not prescribe policy objectives, regulatory measures, or enforcement mechanisms.

---

## 1. Global waste taxonomy and metrics

### Purpose
Provide a common reference model for material and process semantics, together with a consistent set of quantitative metrics and units, to support measurement, reporting, and data exchange across jurisdictions and organisations.

### Function
- Define a hierarchical taxonomy for C&D materials, components, and waste categories, including controlled vocabulary and persistent identifiers.
- Specify normative metadata requirements, including measurement context, provenance, sampling method, and data quality descriptors.
- Standardise units of measure and conversion conventions (mass, volume, count), including documented assumptions for density and geometry where conversion is required.
- Define core indicators and calculation procedures, including uncertainty representation and propagation rules.
- Specify mapping procedures and example crosswalks to align national or organisational taxonomies with the framework reference model.

### Boundaries
- Does not establish legal definitions or supersede statutory classifications.
- Does not mandate regulatory thresholds, compliance criteria, or enforcement actions.
- Does not prescribe operational handling, processing, or treatment methods beyond classification and measurement semantics.

## 2. Waste intelligence and forecasting

### Purpose
Enable technically consistent forecasting, capacity assessment, and trend analysis for C&D material flows using standardised inputs and model specifications.

### Function
- Define data schemas for time-series and event-based records relevant to waste generation, transport, and processing.
- Specify analytic model types and assumptions for forecasting, including trend analysis, scenario-based projection, and uncertainty intervals.
- Specify methods for capacity modelling of processing and transfer infrastructure, including throughput definitions, utilisation metrics, and spatial aggregation units.
- Define validation and back-testing procedures to document predictive performance and model limitations.

### Boundaries
- Does not provide deterministic predictions for decision-making.
- Does not perform operational scheduling, logistics optimisation, or automated resource allocation.
- Does not prescribe policy or economic actions informed by forecast outputs.

## 3. Decision-support methodology

### Purpose
Provide a structured and transparent methodology for comparative technical decision-making where multiple waste management options must be evaluated.

### Function
- Define decision-model structures, including cost accounting templates, multi-criteria analysis schemas, and constraint representations.
- Specify data requirements, sensitivity analysis procedures, and uncertainty treatment for decision outputs.
- Define documentation formats for assumptions, scenarios, and model provenance to ensure reproducibility.
- Specify interoperability interfaces linking decision models with forecasting outputs and operational datasets.

### Boundaries
- Does not prescribe objectives, weighting schemes, or value judgements.
- Does not issue procurement specifications or contractual language.
- Does not replace domain-specific engineering design or expert judgement.

---

## 4. Performance rating and benchmarking

### Purpose
Enable technically consistent computation of comparative performance indicators and structured benchmarking across projects, processes, or facilities.

### Function
- Define performance indicators, normalisation procedures, and reference reporting periods.
- Specify benchmark population construction methods, including inclusion criteria, stratification variables, and anonymisation requirements.
- Define statistical procedures for benchmarking, including confidence interval estimation, outlier treatment, and contextual adjustment.
- Specify minimum data quality and metadata requirements for inclusion in benchmark datasets.

### Boundaries
- Does not operate as an accreditation, certification, or audit body.
- Does not determine regulatory compliance or impose sanctions.
- Does not prescribe normative performance targets or thresholds.

---

## 5. Post-project forensic analysis

### Purpose
Provide standardised technical procedures for post-project verification, discrepancy analysis, and reconstruction of material flows.

### Function
- Define protocols for post-project data collection, including sampling plans, reconciliation procedures, and chain-of-custody metadata.
- Specify mass-balance and reconciliation methods with explicit treatment of uncertainty and data gaps.
- Define formats for documenting discrepancies, root-cause analysis, and forensic findings.
- Specify feedback interfaces linking forensic results to taxonomy updates, forecasting recalibration, and decision-support refinement.

### Boundaries
- Does not adjudicate contractual disputes or issue legal determinations.
- Does not prescribe corrective actions or enforcement measures.
- Does not substitute for independent legal or statutory forensic investigations.

---

## Module interaction and data governance

- All modules reference a common taxonomy and metric set to ensure semantic consistency.
- Data models and metadata schemas are aligned to enable traceability from operational records to aggregated indicators.
- Versioning and change-control rules governing framework artefacts are defined in separate governance documents to ensure reproducibility and auditability.

---

## Framework scope and intent

### Scope
- Geographical scope: global applicability as a technical reference for institutional alignment.
- Material scope: non-hazardous and specified hazardous C&D waste streams arising from building and civil infrastructure works.
- Process scope: activities from on-site generation and demolition through processing, transfer, reuse, recovery, and final disposition, subject to documented exclusions.

### Intent
The framework is intended to support interoperable reporting, comparative technical analysis, procurement specification, lifecycle assessment inputs, and audit-oriented review. It does not prescribe policy decisions, regulatory targets, or market instruments.
