- Use metrics and methodologies as inputs to regulatory analysis or policy development.
- Support cross-jurisdictional comparability without harmonising legislation.

## Auditors and assessors
- Use framework methodologies to structure verification and review.
- Apply forensic procedures for post-project technical analysis.
- Reference standardised data and documentation formats.

## Academic and research institutions
- Use the framework as a reference structure for methodological research.
- Support reproducible analysis and comparative studies.
- Contribute to controlled technical evolution through documented feedback.
