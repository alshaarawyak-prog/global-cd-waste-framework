# Current status

The framework is currently under private development and controlled technical refinement.

Limited pilot application is ongoing in selected contexts to test internal consistency, data interfaces, and methodological completeness. External participation is selective and oriented toward technical validation rather than broad deployment.

No formal accreditation, certification, or public endorsement is issued at this stage.
