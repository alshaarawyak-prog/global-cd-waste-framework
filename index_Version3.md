# Global fragmentation in construction and demolition waste governance

## Context

Construction and demolition (C&D) activities generate large and heterogeneous material flows that routinely extend across jurisdictional, institutional, and contractual boundaries. Despite their scale and persistence, governance arrangements for these flows remain highly fragmented. Definitions, classification systems, metrics, and reporting practices vary significantly between countries, sectors, and projects.

This fragmentation constrains data comparability, complicates regulatory oversight, and undermines technical coordination among public authorities, project owners, contractors, and auditors. In practice, waste-related decisions are frequently based on non-comparable datasets, inconsistent assumptions, and locally defined indicators that lack interoperability beyond their immediate context.

## Framework intent

The Global Construction and Demolition Waste Framework is a privately developed technical reference framework intended to address these structural gaps. It specifies common terminology, data structures, metrics, and methodological constructs that enable consistent interpretation, comparison, and technical discussion of C&D waste across institutional boundaries.

The framework is designed as a modular system. Its components may be referenced, integrated, or adapted by authorities and organisations without superseding existing legal, regulatory, or contractual arrangements.

## Scope

The framework is oriented toward institutional and professional use, including:
- public authorities and regulators,
- large contracting and development organisations,
- engineering and professional institutions,
- auditors and technical assessors,
- academic and research bodies.

It does not function as a regulatory instrument, compliance regime, or advocacy initiative. Its role is to provide a coherent technical structure upon which such instruments may be informed or aligned.
