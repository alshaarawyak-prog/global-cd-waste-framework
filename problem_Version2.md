# The fragmentation problem

Construction and demolition waste governance is characterised by structural fragmentation across jurisdictions and institutional actors. Definitions of waste categories, material classifications, measurement conventions, and reporting units are frequently established independently at national, sectoral, or organisational level.

As a result:
- comparable aggregation of data across projects or regions is limited,
- regulatory oversight relies on heterogeneous and often incompatible inputs,
- technical decisions are frequently informed by locally defined assumptions rather than reproducible models.

In parallel, reporting and disclosure practices often diverge from operational reality. Metrics used for compliance or sustainability reporting may not align with those used for project control, procurement, or auditing. This misalignment limits the technical value of reported data and reduces its usefulness for comparative analysis and institutional learning.

The absence of a shared technical reference framework constrains interoperability, reproducibility, and cumulative knowledge development in construction and demolition waste management.
